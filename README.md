# Convolutional-Neural-Network-For-Dog-Breed-Identification
Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras and TensorFlow to address the task of identifying the breed of a dog from an input image. The project is, specifically a multiclass classification task. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model achieved remarkable accuracy in predicting various breeds of dogs from diverse images.
Through the successful implementation of a CNN-based dog breed identification system, this project showcases my proficiency in deep learning, specifically in the domain of computer vision and multiclass classification tasks. The project's potential societal impact underscores my commitment to leveraging technology for social good, particularly in the realm of animal welfare and education.
